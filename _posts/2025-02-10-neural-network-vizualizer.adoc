Earlier this year, I participated the ConsoleDot hackathon at Red Hat.
With a fellow Red Hatter, we built a neural network from scratch in Java and implemented deep reinforcement learning to make the network play Tic-Tac-Toe.

While that network is nowhere near ready for a blog post, I'd like to share today something I created for the hackathon demo: a way to visualize in real time the activations of the neurons from an HTML UI.

Here's what that looks like:

Before we dig into the details, please note that everything you'll read in this post is available as code in the https://github.com/gwenneg/blog-neural-network-visualizer[gwenneg/blog-neural-network-visualizer] repository.

== How to run it

== Settings

== SVG

== Websocket

== Mock



- SVG
- websocket
- vanilla js, no framework/lib
- controller.js vs l'autre
- impact des settings (visuel)
- how to run it in go
- SVG
- totally dynamic / configurable
- extra ws msg for demo purposes but not in real life
- gorilla websocket
- mock: random values between 0 and 1 + first layer always 1 because input
- ws message every 200 ms from mock
- svg: how it's built
